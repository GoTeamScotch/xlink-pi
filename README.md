# xlink-pi
A wifi bridge and Xlink Kai server for Original Xbox utilizing a Raspberry Pi

TODO:<br>
•Add support for multiple networks in wpa_supplicant.conf -> remembered networks, forget network, sort networks by priority<br>
•Add Xlink Kai status/control with API assistance from CrunchBite<br>
•Add stylesheets for non-Xbox viewing (LinksBoks does NOT support CSS)<br>
•Add wifi to ethernet routing preferably with WDS support (proxy arp)<br>
•Add a nice setup script<br>
•Consider migrating to a psx-pi-smbshare fork (not yet sure if this shares enough in common)
