# xlink-pi
A wifi bridge and Xlink Kai server for Original Xbox utilizing a Raspberry Pi

TODO:
•Add hidden network checkbox -> scan_ssid=1 in wpa_supplicant.conf
•Add support for multiple networks in wpa_supplicant.conf -> remembered networks, forget network, sort networks by priority
•Add Xlink Kai status/control with API assistance from CrunchBite
•Add stylesheets for non-Xbox viewing (LinksBoks does NOT support CSS)
•Add wifi to ethernet routing preferably with WDS support (proxy arp)
•Add a nice setup script
•Consider migrating to a psx-pi-smbshare fork (not yet sure if this shares enough in common)
